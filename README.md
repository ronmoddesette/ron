# Charter Homework for Ron Moddesette

## Problem statement

- A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

- A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

- Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
  (note:  I will assume this means for a specific customer, not ALL customer given this is an API call, otherwise a batch process might be more appropriate)
- Solve using Spring Boot

- Create a RESTful endpoint

- Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution

- Check solution into GitHub
*********************************************************************************

- api call:  http://localhost:8080/customers?id=10
- H2 embedded database - data created for multiple months purchases for customer id 10
- This is a springboot app so load into IDE and run as normal springBoot application.
- Thanks
